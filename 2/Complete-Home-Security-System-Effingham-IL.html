When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<h3>Intruder Alarm System Effingham IL 62401</h3>
<p>Take notice of the existing lighting in the areas where you want to install security cameras. Try to find the night vision series of each camera and think about just how much location you want to cover. And beware of using an indoor camera to look outside; they can't typically record images through a window or after dark.
