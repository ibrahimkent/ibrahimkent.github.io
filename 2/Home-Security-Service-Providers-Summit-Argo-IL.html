<p>Amongst IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the easiest choice to install and all of the recorded video is stored in the cloud.</p>
