(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
