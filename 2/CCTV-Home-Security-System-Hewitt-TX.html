<p>When I speak about my deal with homeland security surveillance and physical security technologies, I normally get the Huge Brother is seeing" remark, describing George Orwell's omnipresent socialistic watcher called Big Bro in his book 1984. This Orwellian" fear is that someone someplace may be seeing you through a video surveillance camera this very minute which someone someplace is abusing the system to break your liberty and personal privacy.
