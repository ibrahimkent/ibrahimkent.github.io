In this case the alarm company owns the primary equipment such as control panel, keypad, motion sensing unit. Anything included extra you would own however if you don't renew their high priced plan they'll remove their" equipment leaving you with no working alarm system. Simply another sly method to retain extremely lucrative accounts.</p>
