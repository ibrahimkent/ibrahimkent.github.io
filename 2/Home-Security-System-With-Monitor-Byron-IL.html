Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
