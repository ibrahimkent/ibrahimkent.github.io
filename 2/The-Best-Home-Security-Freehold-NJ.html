In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private guard. Numerous cities also require an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on false alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
