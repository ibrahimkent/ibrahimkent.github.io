<p>Though most of our attention these days is concentrated on the shift to IP video innovation, it is necessary to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be extremely efficient for lots of surveillance applications, particularly those on a budget plan. With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transmitted in analog format for local viewing from one central monitoring area.
