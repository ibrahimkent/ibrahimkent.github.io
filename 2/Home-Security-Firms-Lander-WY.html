<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
