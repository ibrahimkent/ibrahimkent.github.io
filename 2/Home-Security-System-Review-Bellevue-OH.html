A few of our preferred suppliers enable you to DIY your alarm system installation, while others send out a professional to do the task. Expert installation enables a home security professional to evaluate your home's security needs and inform you on how to best utilize your system. The drawback is that professional installation typically involves an extra charge. When you opt to Do It Yourself, the process is typically quicker and you can avoid any appointment-scheduling balancings.</p>
<p>Nearly all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet goes down or your power heads out, your security system will still work. Nevertheless, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize a web connection as their main communication source.

However, if your web decreases, sadly, you will be without an alarm system till it comes back up.</p>

Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
