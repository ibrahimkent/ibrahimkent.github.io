<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cable televisions. DVR systems are difficult to scale up since when every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to acquire an entirely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the linked cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later created to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken.
