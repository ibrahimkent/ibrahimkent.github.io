<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private guard. Several cities also require a permit to even own and operate a home security system.

<p>Despite the fact that 1080p is normally the standard resolution for cameras we have actually evaluated, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensing units. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but practically all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
