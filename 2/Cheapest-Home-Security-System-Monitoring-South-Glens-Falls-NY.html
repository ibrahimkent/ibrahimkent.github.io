<p>The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide opponents are plainly not hindered by camera - and may even be brought in to the television protection cameras can make sure - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far surpasses the limited benefits that the system may offer in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
