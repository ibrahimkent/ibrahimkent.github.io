<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening.
