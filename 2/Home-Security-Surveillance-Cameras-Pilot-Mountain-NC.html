The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership.

The system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
