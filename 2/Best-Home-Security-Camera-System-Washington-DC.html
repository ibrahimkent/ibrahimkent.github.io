<p>B.

Set a momentary password and reset it as soon as you return if you go on holiday and have somebody coming over to feed pets or check on your home. As more recent security systems shift to cloud-based, wireless platforms, it is very important to guard yourself versus network intrusion simply as you would with securing your identity and virtual properties online.</p>
<p>No incorrect alarm charges: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm.

A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
