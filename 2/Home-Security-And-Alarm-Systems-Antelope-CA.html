<h3>Wireless Camera System Antelope CA 95843</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the producer's stats since this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit limited to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>Unmonitored systems won't provide the same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your mobile phone, there are times when you might not remain in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on an airplane, in an essential conference, or in a location without phone reception.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
