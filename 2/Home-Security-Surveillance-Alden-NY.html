<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may find out to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang drug addicts, hookers or members." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals considered to be "out of time and location" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
