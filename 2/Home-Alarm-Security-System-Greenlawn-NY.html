<h3>Motion Activated Security Camera in Greenlawn NY</h3>

<p>Note: The above CCTV camera types just touch the IP camera world and exclude the old analog cameras, given that everybody favors IP cameras today for their affordable prices, features and easy setup. IP cameras primarily utilize security camera wire types of Cat5 or Cat6, or even NO wires at all. A wired security camera can come in 2 types, both needing wires to provide power and for the purposes of video transmission.
