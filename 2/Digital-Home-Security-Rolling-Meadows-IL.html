Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen often enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
