<h3>CCTV Security System Sandy OR 97055</h3>
<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions. DVR systems are challenging to scale up due to the fact that as soon as every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to purchase an entirely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
