<p>We still think the Ring Alarm is a great alternative for a cheap home security system with clever home support. However perhaps skip the cameras for now. Hard drive storage is safe, secure, and practical, with numerous systems offering expansion and totally free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll require to by hand remove to transfer the information?

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own.

With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
