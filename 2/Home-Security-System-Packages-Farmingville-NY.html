<p>Smoke and fire alarms signal you if they detect a high-level of smoke or if the temperature increases too rapidly, either of which might indicate a fire.

<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve information after the fact, which implies that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of recording storage space. So much, in fact, that they require about four times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is essential.</p>
