<p>Unlike wired security systems that run through your phone lines and can need more extensive installation, wireless systems can be set up in a matter of minutes as a quick and pain-free  DIY project. Convenience is the significant reason individuals change to wireless," says Du, and it's tough to refute a 10-minute setup when the wired option needs expert installation of wires below your house. On the other hand, an alarm that is expertly monitored streamlines this process. Minutes after an alarm is set off, a monitoring specialist checks in with you. The monitoring specialists will dispatch authorities on your behalf if there is a real emergency.</p>
<p>Unmonitored systems won't supply the very same level of protection for your home, either.
