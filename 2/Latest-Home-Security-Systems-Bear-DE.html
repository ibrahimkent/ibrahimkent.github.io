<h2>Smart Surveillance System Bear</h2>
<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning clever alarm, this system was nearly as easy to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensing units had actually been set off. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only signals you when motion is developed by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do require to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and key fobs, too.</p>
