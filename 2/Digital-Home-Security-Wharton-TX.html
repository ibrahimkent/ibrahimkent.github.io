<p>Discover how to develop, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and decrease criminal activity. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
