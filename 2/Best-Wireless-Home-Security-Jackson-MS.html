When buying a system online, understand that the majority of the time professional alarm companies will not install customer purchased items! Why? Alarm companies do not understand if the purchased items are utilized, do not work, or have compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Multiple monitors were installed within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm display screens. As soon as any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the nearest camera to that area would be shown on that specific monitor. The opportunity that the repaired camera would be pointed in the direction of the incident depends upon the initial requirements for location of coverage. If there are three choose fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single set camera can just enjoy one. This produces a one in three possibility of capturing a specific incident on video (either live or taped). The command center also included a computer system designated for submitting incident reports online. These can be accessed by management personnel at a later date from a database by means of the computer network.</p>
