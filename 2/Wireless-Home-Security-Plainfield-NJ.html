When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
