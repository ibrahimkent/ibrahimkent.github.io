<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational crime avoidance developed to prevent both personal and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will minimize criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

The screen lets you interact with a professional monitoring service when an alarm is activated and see video from any of the installed security cameras.</p>

It likewise comes with 2 days of free cloud storage (with a choice for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes.
