This look is recognizable to almost everybody and hence serves as a deterrent to undesirable people. The hope is trespassers and wrongdoers go in other places rather if security cameras are visible. That being stated, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism due to the fact that of their obvious appearance. Additionally, the shape of the camera is perfect for concentrating on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but requires multiple cameras if a user needs to see numerous fixed views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work inside your home or outdoors. They feature a small lip on the end of the camera that adds weather condition protection and lowers glare.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period).
