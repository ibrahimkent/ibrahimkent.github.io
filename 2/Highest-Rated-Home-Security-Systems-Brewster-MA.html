This is likewise referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a culprit being collared, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and reducing provocations that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
