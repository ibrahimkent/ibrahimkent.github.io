The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we may review this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud.
