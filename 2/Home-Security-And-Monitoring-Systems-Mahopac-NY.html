<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
