<p>Most modern CCTV video surveillance systems integrate DVRs (digital video recorders) which enable operators to gain a few of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to browse archived video footage, and also permits users to stream video over a network for remote watching from multiple locations.
