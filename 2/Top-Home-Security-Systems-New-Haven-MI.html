What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have seen some enhancements because the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this review and evaluate, as needed.</p>

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing.
