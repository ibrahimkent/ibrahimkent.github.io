IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out data from the camera and provides power to it.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration.

A wireless bridge is a terrific option for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not need a new keypad. Using numerous sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is tape-recorded and the central-station monitor informs the client. A second alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
