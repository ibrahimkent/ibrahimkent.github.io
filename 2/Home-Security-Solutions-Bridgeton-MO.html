<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not need a new keypad. Using numerous sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is tape-recorded and the central-station monitor informs the client. A second alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
