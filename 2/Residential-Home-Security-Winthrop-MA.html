When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be watched at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being watched by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals may learn to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang drug addicts, members or hookers." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
