<h3>Best Home Security Providers in Minnesota</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it needs to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days.
