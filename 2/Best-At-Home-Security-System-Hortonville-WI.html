After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we checked, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.
