<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
