<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems planned to summon authorities department personnel, requires registration, assessment of fees for extreme incorrect alarm system, supplies treatments for repeat wrongdoers, and provides an effective date. Whether you're utilizing a wireless IP-based system or register for a security element as a part of a "smart home" plan; these innovations depend on user passwords to equip and disarm them.
