Woot has actually also published good deals on wireless security systems in the past. It's a little more difficult to prepare your purchase when shopping at Woot, as most of the offers are only offered for 24-hours.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you walk by.
