Theft prevention is a necessary safety measure to ensure the safety of your personal belongings. A burglar alarm can serve a number of functions to this end. Sometimes, its existence can serve as a deterrent-- burglars are less apt to target a spot where it is most likely that they will experience such interference. In other situations, when they go through with the act, the alarm can serve to alert individuals in the area (in addition to the authorities) that something is wrong. This guarantees a quick reaction and decreases the burglar's possibilities of success.</p>
<p>The real reason cameras are generally deployed is to decrease much pettier crimes. But it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have discovered that they have actually not reduced criminal offense. "When the crime and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the basic downward pattern in crimes and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in specific categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually lowered crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
