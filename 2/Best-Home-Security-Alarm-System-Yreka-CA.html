<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
