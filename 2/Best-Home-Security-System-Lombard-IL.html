<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All items emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy discharged by a things is known as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of identifying small differences in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon information about the temperature distinctions. Because objects are hardly ever specifically the exact same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
