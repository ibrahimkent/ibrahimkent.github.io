<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
