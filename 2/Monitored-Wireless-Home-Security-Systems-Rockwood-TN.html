<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the porch by a certified electrician (who happens to be my hubby).

<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send out signals, make certain it deals with other wise gadgets. Lots of current outdoor Wi-Fi cameras use assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That), an internet service that uses mini programs (applets) that you produce to have the camera communicate with other IFTTT-enabled gadgets. For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a lamp inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera spots motion.</p>
