The answer depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you mean to store and the length of time you plan to keep taped footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.
