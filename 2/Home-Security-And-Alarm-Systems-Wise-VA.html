<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize criminal offense. HD CCTV systems work with conventional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (take a look at the cord behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that implies you have standard analog CCTV security cameras. You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system. That's simply $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the Home Iota All-in-One security camera, an additional contact sensing unit, and a remote key fob.
