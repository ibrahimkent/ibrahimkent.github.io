When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer.
