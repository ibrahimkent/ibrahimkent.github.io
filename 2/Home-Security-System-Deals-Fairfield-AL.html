<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions.

DVRs also require that the connected cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
<p>While all plans feature the Frontpoint app, to unlock video surveillance and advanced wise tech functions, you'll need its $50-per-month Ultimate strategy.
