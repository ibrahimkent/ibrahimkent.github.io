<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for potential package burglars or speak with visitors who stop by.</p>
