The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
