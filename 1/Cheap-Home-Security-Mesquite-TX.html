When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).

<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering a number of years.

The technology slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet economical systems available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and view it later.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by.
