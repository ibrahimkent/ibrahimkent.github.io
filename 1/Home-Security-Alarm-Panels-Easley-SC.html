<h2>Best Home Security Systems & Burglar Alarms Easley</h2>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even trigger false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen regularly enough.

Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, but low signal strength and poor connection are still common problems.
