Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
