<p>Almost all CCTV camera types from top security camera brands are capable of HD recording (4MP, 1080p or 5mp), remote access, IR night vision, motion detection and sending out push notifications via phone. Primarily, wireless security systems offer the apparent benefit of much easier installation over their wired equivalents, however the advantages don't stop there. SEi uses a vast array of video surveillance services for your home, from cameras to digital video recorders that are designed, installed and monitored to offer you maximum video surveillance protection.</p>
<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to fix information after the truth, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of recording storage space. So much, in reality, that they require about four times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to spend more money.</p>
<p>Many modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to gain a few of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capacity, makes it much easier to search archived video footage, and likewise enables users to stream video over a network for remote viewing from multiple areas. Frequently, the mere existence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated intruders. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more determined robbers. If burglars can not see any security cameras, they might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
