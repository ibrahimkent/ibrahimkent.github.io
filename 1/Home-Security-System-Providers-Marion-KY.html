<p>There are 2 main kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet protocol (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a bit more pricey, they use a variety of features that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the differences between the two types of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be.

<p>Flood lights are often utilized in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensors discover movement, the lights illuminate the surrounding area, which will permit you to see who is on your residential or commercial property and will possibly frighten intruders. Better outdoor lighting also suggests a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When choosing flood lights, consider the brightness and distance the light shines. Flood lights can prevent vandals or frighten them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
