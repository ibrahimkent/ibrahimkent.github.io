Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
