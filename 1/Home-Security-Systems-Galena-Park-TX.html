<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much is enough.

Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
