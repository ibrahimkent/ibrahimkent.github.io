<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit restricted to advise as a top choice.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe may be too restricted for you if you have a larger home or property you desire to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's currently offered is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is fantastic for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, however it leaves other parts of your backyard vulnerable. If you have a large backyard or sheds to safeguard, this system might not be the very best fit.

However you can link the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser. Aside from providing easy access to recordings, the app allows you to change level of sensitivity so that you're not getting informs every 2 minutes.</p>
