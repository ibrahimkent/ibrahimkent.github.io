<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective transgressors are less most likely to commit crime if they think they are being viewed or have a greater danger of being apprehended. This is also known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention technique, which argues that opportunities to offend can be minimized by modifying a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and lowering justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
