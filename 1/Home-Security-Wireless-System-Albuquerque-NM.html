Well, it's a packaged security set that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you select the complimentary self-monitor" choice.</p>
<p>While the prices for both packages are affordable given what they offer, lots of consumers have left dissatisfactory reviews on Yelp and in other places, complaining of bad customer service and misleading marketing techniques. So, be encouraged in checking out the small print on the agreement before signing. However, the 30-day threat totally free deal and 2-year service warranty should relieve concerns, somewhat.
