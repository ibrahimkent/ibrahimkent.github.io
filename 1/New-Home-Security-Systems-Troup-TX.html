<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy emitted by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of identifying small distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon info about the temperature level distinctions.
