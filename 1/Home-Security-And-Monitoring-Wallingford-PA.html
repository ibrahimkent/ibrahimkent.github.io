<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face acknowledgment software. The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular person gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to release a clever smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>

Commercial cameras outperform their cheaper cousins due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adjust and record exceptional low light video.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
