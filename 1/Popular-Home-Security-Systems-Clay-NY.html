<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most hard setup understood to man. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You need to play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pets shout, cats squeal, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential wrongdoers are less likely to devote crime if they think they are being viewed or have a greater risk of being collared. This is also known as the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to offend can be minimized by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of an offender being collared, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, decreasing benefits from crime commission, and reducing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the culprit must understand the included surveillance for it to achieve its preferred result.</p>
