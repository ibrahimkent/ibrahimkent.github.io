<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve detail after the truth, which indicates that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and take up a lot of recording storage space. A lot, in fact, that they require about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
