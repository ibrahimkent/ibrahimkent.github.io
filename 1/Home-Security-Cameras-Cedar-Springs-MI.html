<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a great security camera and a remarkable value. It gets an Outstanding rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
