<p>This awesome smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when motion was discovered. We like that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector.
