We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, however low signal strength and bad connection are still common problems. Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and except a general power blackout, are more difficult to disrupt.
