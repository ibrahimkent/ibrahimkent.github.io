All of these cameras can be integrated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic knowledge of alarm systems is practical. Although there are a range of extra system components offered including smoke alarm and wireless security cameras, the basic alarm system consists of three primary parts: a keypad control panel, individual sensing units, and a manned monitoring station.</p>

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great option for long range situations where poles and trees are not present.</p>

An unmonitored system leaves all the work up to you.
