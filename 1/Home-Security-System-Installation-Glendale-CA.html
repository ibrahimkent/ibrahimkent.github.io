<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a form of official surveillance," implying that not only does CCTV have the capability to take the place of cops or security officers but CCTV can also boost officers' abilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008). In addition to working as a deterrent, cameras can alert cops of criminal activities as they happen, which can allow officers to respond quickly and efficiently (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Most contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which enable operators to reap a few of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video to digital, which helps to extend storage capacity, makes it a lot easier to search archived video, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from multiple locations. Often, the mere existence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated intruders. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more determined burglars. They might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
