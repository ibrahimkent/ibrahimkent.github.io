<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering numerous years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually developed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and enjoy it later.
