<p>Prospective burglars by and big prefer much easier targets with the least amount of danger involved. Property owners also sometimes install fake security cameras utilizing the same reasoning. It makes sense that alarm indications alone will hinder some burglars. However, this technique isn't sure-fire: burglars have ended up being smart to the practice of publishing fake indications and cameras, and ever-bolder wrongdoers may be happy to take a risk.
