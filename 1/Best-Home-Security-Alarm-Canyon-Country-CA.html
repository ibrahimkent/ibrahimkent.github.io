<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
