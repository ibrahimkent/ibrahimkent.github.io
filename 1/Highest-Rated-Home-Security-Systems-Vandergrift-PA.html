<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which suggests you can use several various third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera deal with other ONVIF-compliant gadgets.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
