<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensing units, are various in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
