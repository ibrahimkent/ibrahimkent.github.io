<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
