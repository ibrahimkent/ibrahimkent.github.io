As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "individuals might discover to be careful about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers.
