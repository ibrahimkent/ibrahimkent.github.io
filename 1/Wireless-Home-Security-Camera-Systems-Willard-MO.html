Numerous systems utilize smartphone apps as a control, which could give both the individual with an impairment and a caregiver access to the system.</p>
<p>There was when a time when home security suggested spending lavishly on high-end cameras, motion sensing units, and a professional set-up. Not anymore! Gone are those days of expert installation and a complicated purchasing process. With the development of modern innovation you now have smarter and economical home security systems that you can establish all by yourself. Safe Home Starter is the basic package with motion, door, and window sensors. Safe Home Everyday uses extra sensors, while Safe Home Plus includes glass break detection.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
