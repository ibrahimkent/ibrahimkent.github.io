We suggest cellular systems because they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>
<p>Practically all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet decreases or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use a web connection as their primary interaction source.

But, if your internet decreases, unfortunately, you will lack an alarm until it comes back up.</p>
