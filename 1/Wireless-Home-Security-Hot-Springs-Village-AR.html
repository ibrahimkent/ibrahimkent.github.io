<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home components in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, placement is more flexible. When they open, contact sensors are the very first thing you must buy along with the base station; these connect to doors and windows and will alert you.
