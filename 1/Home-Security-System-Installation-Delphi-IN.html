<p>While every property owner stresses over break-ins, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically leading to incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a complimentary smartphone app that allows residents who see something suspicious to take a picture and rapidly send it to public safety authorities. For example, a public transit rider may notice someone behaving suspiciously. Many people are messing, texting or surfing with their mobile devices. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap an image of the suspicious activity and send it to security officials with a couple of clicks. Reports from smart phone users can be rapidly evaluated and acted upon by Public Safety authorities.</p>

I hear this all the time in my everyday operations management of American Alarm Systems. If contract plans don't appeal to you, consider Blue by ADT, which uses DIY installation and self-monitoring. Some alarm systems utilize real-time audio and video monitoring technology to confirm the legitimacy of an alarm. In some municipalities around the United States, this type of alarm verification enables the residential or commercial property it is securing to be placed on a "confirmed action" list, enabling quicker and safer police responses.</p>

<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based on 2 unshielded (or 'dripping') coaxial cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter gives off continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable television. When the modification in field strength deteriorates due to the existence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is created. The system is hidden after installation. Care should be taken to ensure the surrounding soil offers good drainage in order to prevent nuisance alarms.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a strategy that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing several sensors to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor informs the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- received in an adjacent zone within a brief time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch right away. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe need to a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
