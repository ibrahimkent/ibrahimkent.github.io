<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of removing costly false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can instantly make the clever lights turn on to scare away possible robbers.</p>
