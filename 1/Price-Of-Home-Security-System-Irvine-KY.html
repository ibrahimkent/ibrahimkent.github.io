<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is truly terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
