Wi-Fi coverage likewise affects where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in an area that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about updating your router or adding an extender or repeater.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
