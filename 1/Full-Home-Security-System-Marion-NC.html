Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
