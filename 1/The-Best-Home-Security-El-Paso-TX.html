With standard CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transmitted in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring area. But that does not suggest you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to take advantage of your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
