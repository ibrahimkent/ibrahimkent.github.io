Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
