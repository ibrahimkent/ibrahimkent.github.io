The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
