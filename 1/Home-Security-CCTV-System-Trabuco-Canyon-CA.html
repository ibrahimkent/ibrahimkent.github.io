<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were often missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard clever home gadgets like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors.

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
