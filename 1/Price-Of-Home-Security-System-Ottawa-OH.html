<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage alternative conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself. This option is usually cost-free. A cloud storage alternative conserves your video in the cloud.

When something triggers your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and after that inform the authorities for you. Seems like a much safer bet to us.</p>

You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras. And to be truthful, we're not extremely impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first location. What you're spending for is primarily that big name in blue.</p>
