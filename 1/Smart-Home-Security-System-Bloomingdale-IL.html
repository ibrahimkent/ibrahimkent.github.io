<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm system, a number of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Lots of insurance companies offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments provide numerous "free" false alarms before imposing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
