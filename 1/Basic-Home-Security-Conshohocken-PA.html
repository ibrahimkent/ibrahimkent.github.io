<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.
