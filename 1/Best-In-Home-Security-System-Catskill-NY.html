<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

<h3>Smart Home Security Monitoring in New York</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it should be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
