<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and inefficient  approach to theft decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
