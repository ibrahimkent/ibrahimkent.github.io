<p>Among the best elements of this alarm is that it has an extremely sophisticated motion sensing unit.

There's no latency so you get informed instantly so you can take instant actions such as triggering a loud alarm, contacting the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to speak to the potential burglars.</p>
