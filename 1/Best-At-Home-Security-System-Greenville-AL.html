<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to save and the length of time you plan to keep taped footage. The video footage is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
