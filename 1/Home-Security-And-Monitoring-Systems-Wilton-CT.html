<h3>The Best Home Security System in Connecticut</h3>

Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>The 720p camera uses a 172-degree view and color night vision. You can store the videos on the base unit instead of the cloud.
