<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
