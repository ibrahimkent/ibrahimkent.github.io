Owner" indicates anybody, who owns or operates an alarm system, monitored or not monitored from an alarm installation company or monitoring company. Among confirmed customers, the system receives luxury rankings for its clear HD video, strong wireless network signal, and easy setup. The Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is the only surveillance camera that intelligently determines and immediately hinders real hazards. It doesn't just record activity-- it assists avoids crime.
