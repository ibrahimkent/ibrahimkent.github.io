As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals may discover to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts."
