<p>The real reason cameras are usually released is to minimize much pettier criminal activities. However it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the issue have found that they have actually not reduced criminal activity. "When the criminal activity and offence figures were adapted to appraise the general downward pattern in offenses and criminal activities," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were noted in specific classifications however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually minimized criminal activity in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office likewise found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>

<p>Unmonitored systems will not offer the very same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your smartphone, there are times when you might not be in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on an aircraft, in a crucial conference, or in a location without phone reception.
