"Once the criminal offense and offense figures were gotten used to appraise the basic downward pattern in crimes and offences," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular classifications however there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually reduced criminal activity in general in the city centre."
