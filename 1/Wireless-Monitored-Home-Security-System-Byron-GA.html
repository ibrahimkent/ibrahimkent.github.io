Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and in many cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their style allows for minimum glare.

Windows smash, pet dogs groan, cats squeal, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
