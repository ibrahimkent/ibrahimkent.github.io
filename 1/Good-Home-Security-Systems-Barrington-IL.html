<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Terrific clearness. I wished to establish viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for thirty days of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the preliminary charge. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 monthly for person detection with one month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those features and bumps storage approximately 31 days.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
