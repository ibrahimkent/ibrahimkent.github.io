<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to police ability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support authorities action to alarmed properties) a costly and ineffective  approach to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The equipment needed for the wired system tends to be a bit less expensive than the wireless systems.
