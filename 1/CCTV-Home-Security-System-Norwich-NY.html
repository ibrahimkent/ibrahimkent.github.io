<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
