False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they take place frequently enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
