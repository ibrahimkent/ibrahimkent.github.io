<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
