<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard wise home devices like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors.

Unlike numerous cameras, this Vivint outdoor camera includes deterrence features: a red LED light and a caution tone.

You can even match several cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since a lot of retail theft would not trip an alarm anyway (an employee slipping some extra cash while offering a customer change, for example), we believe it's more important to have premium images so you have the evidence you need.

<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in client reviews, and it delivers a crisp image as much as 32 feet. And although the app and software are easy to work with, it's a little a letdown that you can't integrate this camera with any smart home centers or gadgets. A lot of smart cameras can be set to do things like this, but few make things as basic as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives simpler and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function without any frustration.</p>
