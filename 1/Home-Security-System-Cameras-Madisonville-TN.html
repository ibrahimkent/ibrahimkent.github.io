<p>Smart Sensors - Noise an alarm whenever safeguarded windows and doors are opened and can also be utilized to safeguard medication cabinets, gun cabinets, or the door to a child's bed room. Night vision: The majority of burglaries take place after dark, so this function is almost as essential as motion detection.

Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
