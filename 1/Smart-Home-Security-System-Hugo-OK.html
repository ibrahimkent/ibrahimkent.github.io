<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
