<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 features a color night vision alternative, however the black and white variation can in fact be clearer and give you higher-quality video. This isn't truly a big deal thinking about the Argus 2's cost and all its other features-- but for the record, stick to white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. However the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a photovoltaic panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
