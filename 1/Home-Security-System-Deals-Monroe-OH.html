<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we evaluated, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to begin the heating system at 5am. The first guard got here early so he might look at the whole location and talk to me about my concerns. He was professional, considerate and really reassuring. The second guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the early morning to get the event started, he was also expert, considerate and comforting. We were very delighted with your service and I will advise that we get in touch with your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't stress as soon as after leaving our home in your hands.</p>
