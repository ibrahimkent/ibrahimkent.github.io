The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with information after the truth, which means that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of recording storage area.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
