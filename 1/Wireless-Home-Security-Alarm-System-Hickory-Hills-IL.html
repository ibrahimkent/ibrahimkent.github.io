The prompt alert gives you time to fix the scenario prior to any significant damage takes place. All 3 of our top choices for Seattle sell battery-powered flood or water sensing units. They link to the company's particular app, so you're constantly in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensing units cost just $44.99 and provide 3 to 5 times more range than ADT's and Vivint's.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
