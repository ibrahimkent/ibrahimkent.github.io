<p>Flood sensors do not avoid water from entering your home, they simply inform you as quickly as wetness is detected. The prompt alert gives you time to fix the scenario prior to any significant damage takes place. All 3 of our top choices for Seattle sell battery-powered flood or water sensing units. They link to the company's particular app, so you're constantly in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensing units cost just $44.99 and provide 3 to 5 times more range than ADT's and Vivint's.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
